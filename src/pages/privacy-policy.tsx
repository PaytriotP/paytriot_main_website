          <h3>Credit Reference Agencies and Fraud Prevention</h3>
          <div>
            We will exchange your&nbsp;<strong>Personal Information</strong>
            &nbsp;with credit reference agencies (CRAs) and fraud prevention
            agencies (FPAs). We may obtain&nbsp;
            <strong>Personal Information</strong>&nbsp;about you from these
            agencies including, where relevant, your spouse, and any business in
            which you are involved (including details of your co-directors or
            partners in business). For these purposes you may be treated as
            financially linked to such persons ("financial associates") and you
            will be assessed with reference to their "associated records". You
            must be sure that you have your financial associates’ agreement to
            disclose information about them.
            <br />
            &nbsp;
          </div>
          <h4>When you apply</h4>
          <div>
            If you are a director of a business, we will seek confirmation from
            CRAs that the residential address that you provide is the same as
            that shown on the restricted register of directors’ usual addresses
            at Companies House. CRAs will record information about your business
            and its proprietors and may create a record of the name and address
            of your business and its proprietors if there is not one already.
            <br />
            &nbsp;
          </div>
          <h4>During the lifetime of your account</h4>
          <div>
            We will continue to make searches at CRAs to assist in managing your
            account and this will include looking at the associated records of
            your financial associates. These searches will not be seen or used
            by other organisations to assess your ability to obtain credit. We
            will also carry out further credit checks whilst any money is owed
            by you on your account (including contacting your bank, building
            society or any referee approved by you).
            <br />
            <br />
            We may tell CRAs the current balance on your account and we may tell
            them if you do not make payments when due. They will record this
            information on your personal and business credit files (as
            applicable) and it may be shared with other organisations for the
            purpose of assessing applications from you, and applications from
            any other party with a financial association with you, for credit or
            other facilities, for other risk management purposes and for
            preventing fraud and tracing debtors. Failure to make repayments may
            impair your credit rating. Records shared with CRAs remain on file
            for 6 years after they are closed whether settled by you or
            defaulted.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will analyse your&nbsp;<strong>Personal Information</strong>
            &nbsp;to assist in managing your account and to prevent fraud or any
