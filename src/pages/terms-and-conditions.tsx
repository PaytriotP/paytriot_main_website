                website throughout the world that accepts the brand of Your
                Virtual-Card. To use Your Virtual-Card, provide the card number,
                the security code, if applicable, and the expiration date to the
                Internet merchant. We reserve the right in our sole discreton to
                prohibit acceptance of Your Virtual-Card at certain Internet
                merchant websites that accept the relevant Virtual-Card.
                <br />
                <br /> You may fund Your Virtual-Card with money in any one of
                Your e-Wallets. You may move funds from Your Virtual-Card to
                Your e-Wallet for extra security. <br />
                <br /> We neither accept nor assume any liability to ensure that
                goods or services that You purchase using Your Virtual-Card are
                as advertised for sale or will meet Your satisfaction. <br />
                <br /> <h4>D. The Card</h4> You may purchase a Card at the time
                You purchased Your Account, or at any time thereafter. You may
                also have been provided a Card by another party. Please note
                that funds that are in any of Your e-Wallets or are on your
                Virtual-Card are not available when You use Your Card until You
                have transferred the funds from one or more of Your e-Wallets or
                Your Virtual-Card to Your Card. <br />
                <br /> If You have purchased a Card, or someone purchased a Card
                for You, We will mail Your Card to the address that was provided
                to Us. The Card will display Your name, a card number, a
                Security Code, and the expiration date of Your Card. Your Card’s
                card number will not be the same as Your Virtual-Card Number and
                they may have different expiration dates. Once You receive Your
                Card, You will be required to go onto Our website at
                www.paytriot.co.uk to authenticate Yourself, activate Your Card,
                and create Your own Personal Identification Number ("PIN"). DO
                NOT KEEP YOUR PIN WRITTEN DOWN IN ANY LOCATION THAT MAY BE
                ACCESSED BY ANYONE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU.
                <br />
                <br /> Your Card can be used at any merchant worldwide that has
                the ability to accept cards with the same branding as Your Card.
                You can use Your Card by: (1) inserting Your Card into a
                Point-of-Sale (“POS”) terminal that reads EMV Chips and entering
                your PIN into the POS terminal; (2) inserting Your Card into a
                POS terminal that reads EMV Chips and signing the transaction
                receipt; (3) swiping the magnetic stripe on the Card, and either
                entering Your PIN on a PIN pad, or signing a transaction
                receipt. You may also be able to use Your Card at some merchants
                who will key Your Card number, expiration date and Security Code
                into a physical terminal. At some merchants in certain countries
                for certain transactions, Card Organization rules provide that
                You may not be required to either enter Your PIN or sign a
                transaction receipt. In both aforementioned cases, Your Card
                must be electronically authorized and You will be responsible
                for these transactions as if You had entered Your PIN or signed
                the transaction receipt. <br />
                <br /> Your Card can also be used to withdraw available funds
                from Your Account at any ATM bearing the same branding as Your
                Card by: (1) inserting Your Card into a Point-of-Sale (“POS”)
                terminal that reads EMV Chips and entering your PIN into the
                ATM; or (2) swiping the magnetic stripe on the card and entering
                Your PIN. Notwithstanding the above regarding acceptance of Your
                Card, We reserve the right to prohibit acceptance of Your Card
                at certain merchants and/or merchant categories and/or ATMs that
                generally accept Your Card, at Our sole discretion. <br />
                <br /> We neither accept nor assume any liability to ensure that
                goods or services that You purchase using Your Card are as
                advertised for sale or will meet Your satisfaction. <br />

                    authorization from the merchant or ATM provider which
                    reduces the amount of funds in Your Account that are
                    available to spend by the amount of the authorized purchase
                    or ATM withdrawal. This is a pending authorization and it
                    will remain on Your Account, reducing Your available funds,
                    until one of the following events occurs: (i) a settlement
                    transaction is received from the merchant or ATM that
                    matches the pending authorization amount; (ii) up to thirty
                    five (35) days have passed since the transaction date; or
                    (iii) We are in receipt of an authorization release from the
                    merchant or ATM owner which states that the merchant will
                    not be processing a settlement transaction for the
                    authorized amount. At this time, the pending authorization
                    will be removed from Your Account. If a settlement
                    transaction has been received from the merchant or the ATM,
                    the exact amount of the purchase or ATM withdrawal will be

                    When You attempt a purchase at an unattended Automatic Fuel
                    Dispenser ("AFD"), the transaction may automatically be
                    denied even though You might have sufficient funds in Your
                    Account. It also may automatically be authorized against
                    Your Account for US$75, provided You have at least US$75 in
                    Your Account. If You do not have US$75 of available funds in
                    Your Account, the transaction will be denied. If the
                    transaction is authorized, the actual value of fuel that You
                    purchase from the AFD will be debited from Your Account and
                    the US$75 authorization will be removed. If Your transaction
